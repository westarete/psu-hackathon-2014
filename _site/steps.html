<p><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>: A general-purpose programming language that was created in the mid-1990’s by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto">Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto</a>. Matz designed the language to be powerful and flexible, yet easy to learn and pleasant to use.</p>

<p>RubyGems: A way to package up other developers’ Ruby code and share it with others. Each package is called a “gem”.</p>

<p>Bundler: The system that Ruby developers use to specify, download, and install RubyGems for your application.</p>

<p>Gemfile: A file that lives in your source code. You use it to tell Bundler which RubyGems to install for your project.</p>

<p><code>bundle install</code>: The command that you use to tell Bundler to install or refresh the gems that are named in your Gemfile.</p>

<p>localhost: This is always the network address of the machine that you’re currently working on. So if you visit http://localhost/ , you’re trying to visit a website on the machine that you’re using. This is useful when you’re developing a website on your laptop, because you’re usually doing exactly that, over and over and over.</p>

<h2 id="step_1__install_our_first_gems">Step 1 - Install our first gems</h2>

<p>Create a new file called <code>Gemfile</code> and open it in your editor. This is where we tell Bundler which RubyGems to install. Fill it with the following contents:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><code class="ruby">
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'sinatra'
gem 'sinatra-contrib'
</code></pre>

<p>This tells Bundler to install <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>, a simple web framework for Ruby. Think Rails, but <em>way</em> faster and simpler.</p>

<p>Go to the command line in your source directory. Run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>More info: This will cause the Bundler to go download the Sinatra gems and install them in <code>vendor/bundle</code>, which is where Ruby will keep all the gems for your app. Bundler keeps track of exactly which version it installed via the file <code>Gemfile.lock</code>. You should keep this file around, but don’t edit it directly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the only time we need to specify the path. From here on out when we install more gems, we’ll just be able to run <code>bundle install</code>.</p>

<h2 id="step_2__create_our_initial_web_app">Step 2 - Create our initial web app</h2>

<p>Create another file next to the Gemfile and call it <code>app.rb</code>. This is where we’ll create the code that actually runs the core of our application. Fill it with the following contents:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><code class="ruby">
require 'rubygems'
require 'bundler/setup'
require 'sinatra'
require 'sinatra/reloader' if development?

get '/' do
  &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>Believe it or not, this is enough code to create a complete Ruby web application. To run it, run the following command (again, while in your project’s source code directory):</p>

<pre><code>
ruby app.rb
</code></pre>

<p>You’ll get a message about Sinatra starting, and the program will wait. The web server is now running on your machine and waiting for you to visit it. You can visit it here:</p>

<p>http://localhost:4567/</p>

<p>You should see a plain white page with a little “Hello, World!” in the upper left-hand corner.</p>

<p>Now modify the “Hello, World!” text (keep the quotes), hit reload in your browser, and make sure you can see the updated changes.</p>

<p>Congratulations! This is the usual workflow for developing web sites.</p>

<h2 id="bonus__deploy_your_application_to_heroku">Bonus - Deploy your application to Heroku</h2>

<p><a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> is a hosting service for Rails, Sinatra and other web applications. If you deploy your application there (or at any hosting provider), it can have a public place on the web where other people can visit it.</p>

<p>In order to do this, we need to create a special configuration file that tells Heroku how to start up the application.</p>

<p>Create a file called <code>config.ru</code> and put the following code in it:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><code class="ruby">
require './app'
run Sinatra::Application
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can create a free account at <a href="heroku.com">heroku.com</a>, create a space for your app, and then follow their instructions for pushing the site to their servers so that it’s hosted there.</p>

<p>You can see an example of this application hosted at Heroku here:</p>
